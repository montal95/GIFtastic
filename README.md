The purpose of this page is to allow the user to look up gif's while using the GIPHY API.

An original selection of buttons is available on the load of the page, but additional buttons can be added when the user does a search using the input form. After the input form is used, a new button is added with the user's input.

A list of 12 gifs will be generated on the click of each button matching the keyword. The gif will begin or halt animation on the click of each individual image.
